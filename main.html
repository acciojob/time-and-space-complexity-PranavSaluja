	<h1>Time , Space , Complexity</h1>
	<p>Time complexity tells us how the execution time grows 
	as the input size increases . This analysis make the algorithm efficient </p>
	<p>the amount of memory space an algorithm or data structure uses to solve a problem, as a function of the input size to make is called <b>Space Complexity</b> eg O(n) </p>
